{:title "Yeticast #0: Bug fix for subexpression evaluation"
 :layout :post
 :tags  ["bugfix" "screencast"]}

Welcome to the 0th yeticast!

In this episode we fix issue
[#784](https://github.com/yetibot/yetibot/issues/784) in which subexpression
evaluation was very broken due to recent improvements in error handling.

Sorry for the not-so-great quality. It ended up being about 720p even though I
had done a few test runs with much higher resolution. It apparently matters what
order in Zoom you:

1. share desktop
1. start camera
1. press record

I'll research better screencasting options, or just figure out Zoom's quirks
before I record another.

It's also quite a bit longer than expected, but I'm publishing it anyway to
force myself to do better next time. In the middle I realize I didn't actually
know how to fix the bug, which felt awkward, but thankfully through some poking
around in the REPL I recovered and figured it out. Fast forward to around minute
35 if you want to skip to where I actually figure out what I'm doing.

Let me know if you have feedback or requests on what to screencast next in the
comments. I'd like to cast a dev setup along with other features and bug fixes
that make it easier for new contributors to get started.
