It's time to move [mutable config](https://yetibot.com/ops-guide#mutable) to the
database. Why?
[Immutable infrastructure](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-immutable-infrastructure).

Yetibot embraces
[modern infrastructure](https://devth.com/2018/dec-deep-environmental-config)
best practices. We made a lot of progress moving to mostly-immutable
configuration. This is the next step.

One reason why we haven't done this up till now is that mutable config has never
been relied upon much. Currently it serves two purposes:

1. Store channel-specific configuration (e.g. `jira-project`, `broadcast`,
   `jenkins-default` or any other arbitrary room-specific key/value). The
   `category` command relies on these settings as well to disable or enable
   specific categories of command in a channel.
1. Remember which channels Yetibot should join upon connecting to IRC.

Previously these values would be persisted to a local edn file which by default
lives at `config/mutable.edn`. However, in modern cloud environments this is not
durable. For example when running Yetibot on Kubernetes this would be lost on
each pod creation (unless a durable disk was mounted, but that's an unnecessary
complication). We already have a durable place to store keys and values: the
Postgres database.

## What does this mean for me?

Given that mutable config hasn't been heavily used the migration should be quite
painless. We are not providing an automated migration tool, so your options are:

1. Do nothing if you're not using any mutable config yet (quite likely) ðŸ˜….
1. Use Yetibot to recreate the config, e.g. `channel set jia-project myjira`.
1. Look in `config/mutable.edn` and manually copy the key/values and chat source
   rooms to the `yetibot_channels` Postgres table. For example, if your
   `mutable.edn` looks like:

   ```edn
   {:room
    {:ybslack
     {"#general" {:disabled-categories #{:crude}},
      "#dev" {"jira-project" "YETIBOT",
              "nope" "lol",
              :disabled-categories #{:crude}}}}}
   ```

   You would create rows in `yetibot_channels`:

<table>
<tr>
  <th>`chat_source_adapter`</th>
  <th>`chat_source_room`</th>
  <th>`key`</th>
  <th>`value`</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>:ybslack</td>
  <td>#general</td>
  <td>disabled-categories</td>
  <td>#{:crude}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>:ybslack</td>
  <td>#dev</td>
  <td>jira-project</td>
  <td>YETIBOT</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>:ybslack</td>
  <td>#dev</td>
  <td>nope</td>
  <td>lol</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>:ybslack</td>
  <td>#dev</td>
  <td>disabled-categories</td>
  <td>#{:crude}</td>
</tr>

</table>

All values in the table are strings.

Here's the [Pull Request](https://github.com/yetibot/yetibot.core/pull/61) that
made these changes.
