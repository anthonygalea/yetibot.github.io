Yetibot finally has a site!

Check out the [source on GitHub](https://github.com/yetibot/yetibot.github.io)
here if you're so inclined. It's powered by [Cryogen](http://cryogenweb.org/),
the Clojure-based static site generator.

## Interactive example

One of the goals with launching the site was to have inline interactive Yetibot
examples that uses the GraphQL API on the public Yetibot instance to evaluate!
